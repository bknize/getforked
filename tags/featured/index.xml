Do it this way or DIE haha just kidding, it&amp;rsquo;s good though. And use the anchovies, they dissolve, it&amp;rsquo;s fine. Skip &amp;rsquo;em and sub the butter for more olive oil if you need it vegan.
This recipe is modified from Kenji&amp;rsquo;s to be lazier.

This recipe steals significantly from a renowned chef known as CajunÂ Ron, who might not want his exact recipe published, so I will not denote which pieces come from him or from me except in one specific instance. It&amp;rsquo;s very close to that etouffee in New Orleans.</description></item><item><title>Kasley Family Dumplings</title><link>https://getforked.recipes/recipes/kasley-family-dumplings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://getforked.recipes/recipes/kasley-family-dumplings/</guid><description>Dough 1 cup of mashed potatoes &amp;ndash; russet, boiled and mashed, no milk or butter. 5 cups white flour Tsp salt 4 eggs 1/4 cup milk, or more Mix with stand mixer or food processor until dough pulls off side of bowl.
