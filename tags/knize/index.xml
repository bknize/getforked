This is why my recipe is so smooth and accessible; the white beans are less opinionated and blend more easily than chickpeas. As such, I do not recommend adding a lot of cayenne or chilis in your spice mix of choice. Garnish with sriracha before serving or buy spicy chips to dip, instead.</description></item><item><title>Beniamino's Red Sauce</title><link>https://getforked.recipes/recipes/beniaminos-red-sauce/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://getforked.recipes/recipes/beniaminos-red-sauce/</guid><description>This is it, this is my tomato sauce. Do it this way or DIE haha just kidding, it&amp;rsquo;s good though. And use the anchovies, they dissolve, it&amp;rsquo;s fine. Skip &amp;rsquo;em and sub the butter for more olive oil if you need it vegan.
This recipe is modified from Kenji&amp;rsquo;s to be lazier.

This recipe steals significantly from a renowned chef known as CajunÂ Ron, who might not want his exact recipe published, so I will not denote which pieces come from him or from me except in one specific instance. It&amp;rsquo;s very close to that etouffee in New Orleans.</description></item><item><title>Knize Apple Pie</title><link>https://getforked.recipes/recipes/knize-apple-pie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://getforked.recipes/recipes/knize-apple-pie/</guid><description>Bake at 450 for 10min Then 375 for 40-50min
