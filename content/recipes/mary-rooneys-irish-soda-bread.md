## Dough

* 4 cups regular, white flour
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* Tsp salt
* Tsp baking powder
* Tsp baking soda
* 1/4 cup salted butter, room temperature
* 2 cups raisins, mix of regular and golden
* 1 1/3 cup buttermilk
* 1 unbeaten egg
* Egg whites for brushing

## Directions

1. Mix the first four ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder).
2. Cut in the butter -- slice into little pieces, drop it throughout the flour mixture, use a fork to cut/moosh it in.
3. Stir in raisins.
4. Add buttermilk, making soda, egg.
5. Mix with hands to form a ball -- shouldn't be sticky; add a dusting of flour if sticky.
6. Place the ball on a greased pie plate -- use PAM to grease.
7. Cut a cross shape in the top of the bread, at least an inch deep. <sup>1</sup>
8. Rub the top of the loaf with egg white -- use your hands to smear it on, not a brush, to ensure proper coverage.

Bake at 375, check after one hour.
Insert a cake tester or knife into various places in the loaf. If the knife comes out clean, it's done. The crust should be golden/dark brown.

<sup>1</sup> Mom will tease the quarters away from eachother to open up the cross cuts; she insists this process is essential for the loaf to cook through.
