## Ingredients

* 2 cans of red beans (or pinto beans)
* 4 pieces' bacon grease
* 1/2 cup Water
* Salt
* Smoked paprika
* Cooked white rice (instructions not included)

## Instructions

1. Cook the bacon in a high-walled pan (such as a cast iron skillet)
2. Pour 2 cans of beans directly into the skillet, bean-water and all. Do not rinse, do not pass go, dump the whole thing in.
3. Bring the bean water to boil, then turn down heat to simmer.
4. With a spoon or potato masher or whatever, mash a bunch of the beans.
5. Once the bean water and mashed beans have reduced to a thick bean slurry, add the water (to prevent the paprika from burning), salt, and paprika.
6. Add more water until desired consistency; I like them on the runny side.

That's it. Delicious, soft, flavorful red beans. Serve with a dollop of white rice in the middle.
