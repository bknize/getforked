The 2-to-1 ratio of chickpeas to white beans comes from foul, a white bean dip, served warm, that endures an unfortunate homograph. This is why my recipe is so smooth and accessible; the white beans are less opinionated and blend more easily than chickpeas. As such, I do not recommend adding a lot of cayenne or chilis in your spice mix of choice. Garnish with sriracha before serving or buy spicy chips to dip, instead. And optionally use less garlic if you are a coward.

## Ingredients

* 1 can chickpeas
* 1/2 can white beans (Great Northern or Cannellini)
* 1 tbsp lemon juice, fresh squeezed
* 1/4 tahini
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 2 tbsp minced garlic, or garlic paste
* Cumin
* Curry spice, or mix of your choice
* Salt to taste

Goes great with veggies like cucumber and celery or carbs like naan, pita, and pretzels.

## Instructions

1. Drain and rinse the beans; if you heat them in the bean water, it will be too salty.
2. Heat the beans in an amount of water equivalent to what you just drained (so 1 1/2 cans). You're just replacing the salty can water with fresher, less salty water.
3. Bring to boil, then turn down to simmer or you'll burn your spices.
4. Add garlic, tahini, cumin, spices, lemon juice. DO NOT add the olive oil now because agitating it with a blender causes it to go bitter.
5. Mix vigorously by hand with a spoon or potato masher, coarsely mashing the beans.
6. Food process or immersion blend until smooth.
7. Now mix in the olive oil and salt.
8. Transfer to a serving bowl and smooth the top with the back of your spoon like cake batter.
9. Garnish with more minced garlic, or sesame seeds, or another olive oil drizzle, or sriracha, or everything bagel topping, or...
