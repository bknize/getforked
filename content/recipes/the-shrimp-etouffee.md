I had the best gat dang crawfish etouffee of my life in a pub in New Orleans in like 2016 and I've been chasing that dragon ever since. This recipe steals significantly from a renowned chef known as Cajun&nbsp;Ron, who might not want his exact recipe published, so I will not denote which pieces come from him or from me except in one specific instance. It's very close to that etouffee in New Orleans.

* 1/4 cup celery, minced

2. Using a strainer or mesh bowl, dust the flour evenly into the oil, avoiding clumps.
3. Stir constantly over medium heat to a light-brown color with a peanutbutter smell.
4. Remove from heat (and do not leave it over the hot burner, either.)

## Instructions

3. Add clam juice, seasoned shrimp or crawfish.
4. Bring to boil, then heat and cook for 15 minutes, uncovered.

<sup>1</sup> The detail of preparing and reserving the roux separate the veggies and shrimp was the key which unlocked this whole recipe. Thanks, Ron.
